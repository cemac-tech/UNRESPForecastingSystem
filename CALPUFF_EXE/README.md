# CALPUFF_EXE

Directory for the CALPUFF executables

(these are built separately, i.e. not included in git repository)

## Build (recommended)

If your system has intel compilers ./Run_ext.sh will check if the executables exist here, and build them here if not.

## Prebuilt option (available on request)

The current set up uses proprietary intel compilers, if these are not available the executables must be place here alongside the relevant libraries in the libraries folder. Runing ./Run_ext.sh will add to the library path and use the prebuilt executables.

## Future

Gfortran option possible in Future
