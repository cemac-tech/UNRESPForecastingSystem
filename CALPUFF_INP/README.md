All user-editable input files for the various parts of the CALPUFF system are stored in subdirectory `CALPUFF_INP`. Template versions of these files have been set up specifically for the Masaya case and are version controlled. Various run-specific fields (e.g. run date) are then filled in at run-time. Information about setting up these input files for the Masaya case is also within [this](https://github.com/cemac/UNRESP/blob/master/Docs/CEMACUserGuide_UNRESP.tex) file.
