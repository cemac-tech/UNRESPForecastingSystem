All other input data files are stored in the `data` subdirectory. These include the 90m resolution DEM data files from the SRTM 3-sec dataset covering the Masaya region (4 .bil files), the old 1km resolution DEM data file from the GTOPO30 dataset (w100n40.dem) which isn't used any more but is retained for reference, the USGS land-use data file covering North/Central America (nalulcl20.bil), and a two-column file of UTM zone 16P coordinates which specify discrete receptor points at which we want output data (xy_masaya.dat). Some of the output files from parts of the forecasting system that serve as input files to subsequent parts are also copied into this directory during run-time.
